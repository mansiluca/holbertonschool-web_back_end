# Python Variable Annotations

## Description
This project focuses on type annotations in Python 3. It covers how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types, as well as how to validate code using mypy.

## Learning Objectives
* Type annotations in Python 3
* How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or higher
* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3
* All files should end with a new line
* First line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All modules should have documentation
* All classes should have documentation
* All functions should have documentation
* All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Tasks
The repository contains several Python scripts demonstrating variable annotations:

* Basic annotations for variables
* Complex types (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
* Type definitions and aliases
* Parameter and return value annotations
* Duck typing validations

## Usage
```bash
$ python3 script_name.py
```

To check annotations with mypy:
```bash
$ mypy script_name.py
```
