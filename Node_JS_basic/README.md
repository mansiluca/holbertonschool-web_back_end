# Node.js Basics

This repository contains tasks for learning the basics of Node.js for backend development.

## Overview

This project covers fundamental concepts of Node.js including:
- Running JavaScript using Node.js
- Using Node.js modules
- Reading files with Node.js
- Creating HTTP servers with Node.js and Express
- Creating advanced routes with Express
- Using ES6 with Node.js with Babel
- Unit testing with Mocha and asserting with Chai

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node.js v12.x.x
- npm version 6.x.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the JS standard style (using eslint)

## Setup

```bash
# Install Node.js 12.x
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y

# Verify installation
nodejs -v
npm -v

# Install project dependencies
npm install
```

## Tasks

1. Executing basic JavaScript with Node.js
2. Using Process stdin
3. Reading files synchronously with Node.js
4. Reading files asynchronously with Node.js
5. Creating HTTP server using Node.js
6. Creating HTTP server using Express.js
7. Working with routes in Express
8. Organizing a complex HTTP server using Express

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test
```
