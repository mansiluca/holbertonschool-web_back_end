# Python Async Function

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await` syntax. Asynchronous programming allows operations to run concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the `async` and `await` syntax in Python
- Learn how to execute async programs with `asyncio`
- Implement concurrent code using `asyncio.create_task`
- Use `random` module effectively in async operations
- Master Python's Type annotations with async functions

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)

## Tasks
- Implement basic async syntax
- Work with concurrent coroutines
- Handle task waiting and delays
- Create tasks with asyncio
- Use the random module in async operations
